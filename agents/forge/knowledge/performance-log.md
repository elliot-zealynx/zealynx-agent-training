# Rust Shadow Audit Performance

| Date | Contest | Findings Found | Findings Missed | Precision | Recall | Key Lessons |
|------|---------|---------------|----------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 2026-02-03 | Pump Science (C4, Solana/Rust, $20K) | 2-3/5 (H-01, M-03, partial M-02) | 2 (H-02, M-01) | 100% | 40-60% | Gap in logic bugs (incomplete setters) and ordering dependencies. Signer/CPI patterns solid. Need rent-accounting, fee-ordering, setter-validation, boundary-math patterns. |
| 2026-02-04 | Orderly Solana Vault (Sherlock, Solana/Rust+EVM, $56.5K) | 3/3 (H-01, H-02, M-01) | 0 | 100% | 100% | Pattern #04 (Account Data Matching) caught H-1, Pattern #01 (Signer Bypass) caught H-2, cross-chain analysis caught M-1. Smaller codebase + classic vuln types = strong pattern match. New gap: cross-chain integration patterns need formalization. |
| 2026-02-07 | Orderly Solana Vault (Re-audit, blind) | 1.5/2.5 (H-02 match, M-01 partial) | 1 (H-01 token bypass) | 50% | 60% | **Major gap:** Missed token allowlist bypass (H-01) - need bidirectional flow analysis. Caught withdrawal authorization bypass (H-02) via account confusion patterns. Lesson: Business logic validation ≠ infrastructure validation. |
| 2026-02-05 | Solana Foundation Token22 (C4, Solana/Rust, $203.5K) | 4/8 Low (L-01,L-02,L-03,L-04) | 4 Low (L-05,L-06,L-07,L-info) | 100% | 50% | 0 H/M in contest. Caught all classic Solana vulns (assert! panic, account validation, overflow, PDA). Missed ALL crypto hygiene findings (zeroization x2, Debug key leak). New category needed: Cryptographic Hygiene. |
| 2026-02-08 | Orderly Solana Vault (Shadow Re-audit) | 1/3 (H-01) | 2/3 (H-02, M-01) | 50% | 33% | Caught token validation gap. Missed withdrawal flow authority and LayerZero ordering. Gap: Need complete flow analysis (deposit+withdraw), cross-chain patterns, /// CHECK account validation. |
| 2026-02-09 | Solana Foundation Token22 (Shadow ZK Focus) | 5 Crypto issues | N/A (training) | 100% | N/A | **PERFECT PATTERN MATCH**: All 5 findings mapped to cryptographic hygiene patterns (3x Debug leaks, 1x memory zeroization, 1x ephemeral secrets). Validated pattern detection methodology. Range proof ephemeral secrets = major finding. |
