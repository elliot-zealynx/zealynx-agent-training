# Forge (Rust Researcher) - Performance Tracking

**Agent:** Forge  
**Specialization:** Rust/Solana/Move Security  
**Started Tracking:** February 10, 2026

## Performance Summary

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Precision | TBD | >80% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| Recall | TBD | >60% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| False Positive Rate | TBD | <20% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| Shadow Audits Completed | 6 (old method) | 20+ | 📊 Starting New Protocol |

## Current Status: NEEDS BASELINE

Forge has completed shadow audits using the old methodology but needs to establish baseline performance with the new tracking system.

### Previous Shadow Audits (Pre-New Protocol)
*Note: Previous audits used old methodology - only final results, no false positive tracking*
- 2026-02-09: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)
- 2026-02-08: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking) 
- 2026-02-07: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)
- 2026-02-05: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)
- 2026-02-04: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)
- 2026-02-03: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)

## Next Actions

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
- [ ] **Wait for next Rust/Solana contest** to establish baseline
- [ ] **Study new shadow audit protocol** thoroughly
- [ ] **Review Sol's Merkl baseline** to understand the process
- [ ] **Prepare finding documentation template** for Rust/Solana audits

### First Baseline Audit Requirements
1. **Document ALL findings** using new protocol template
2. **Include reasoning** for each finding identified  
3. **Set confidence levels** honestly
4. **Submit complete findings** before seeing contest results
5. **Perform thorough analysis** after results available

### Focus Areas for Rust/Solana Security
- **Memory safety** issues in Rust smart contracts
- **Signer validation** in Solana programs  
- **Account validation** and ownership checks
- **Integer overflow** in token calculations
- **Cross-program invocation** security
- **PDA derivation** vulnerabilities

## Expected Knowledge Strengths
Based on specialization in Rust/Solana:
- Strong understanding of Rust memory safety
- Familiarity with Solana program architecture
- Experience with Anchor framework patterns
- Knowledge of Solana runtime constraints

## Performance Targets

### Month 1 (Baseline Establishment)
- **Complete 2 shadow audits** with new protocol
- **Establish precision/recall baseline** 
- **Identify top 3 knowledge gaps**
- **Update knowledge base** with new patterns

### Month 2-3 (Improvement)
- **Achieve 40%+ precision, 20%+ recall**
- **Reduce false positive rate** below 60%
- **Complete 4 more shadow audits**
- **Develop Rust/Solana-specific expertise**

### Month 4-6 (Target Performance)
- **Achieve 80%+ precision, 60%+ recall**
- **Reduce false positive rate** below 20%  
- **Become reliable Rust/Solana auditor** for Carlos
- **Lead on Rust/Solana audit engagements**

## Notes for Carlos

### Current Status
Forge needs to establish baseline with new methodology. Previous work provides experience but no measurable performance metrics.

### Specialization Value
- Rust/Solana expertise is high-demand specialty
- Less competition than Solidity auditing
- Higher potential value per finding
- Emerging ecosystem with new attack patterns

### Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Wait for appropriate contest, study new protocol
- **Week 3-4:** Complete first baseline shadow audit
- **Month 2-3:** Establish reliable performance metrics  
- **Month 4-6:** Achieve professional auditor performance levels

**Next Step:** Wait for next Solana/Rust contest to begin baseline establishment.
