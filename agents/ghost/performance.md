# Ghost (Web2 Researcher) - Performance Tracking

**Agent:** Ghost  
**Specialization:** Web2/Infrastructure Security  
**Started Tracking:** February 10, 2026

## Performance Summary

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Precision | TBD | >80% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| Recall | TBD | >60% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| False Positive Rate | TBD | <20% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| Shadow Audits Completed | 6 (old method) | 20+ | 📊 Starting New Protocol |

## Current Status: NEEDS BASELINE

Ghost has completed shadow audits using the old methodology but needs to establish baseline performance with the new tracking system.

### Previous Shadow Audits (Pre-New Protocol)
*Note: Previous audits used old methodology - only final results, no false positive tracking*
- 2026-02-08: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)
- 2026-02-07: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)
- 2026-02-05: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)
- 2026-02-04: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)
- 2026-02-03: Previous shadow audit (basic tracking)

## Next Actions

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
- [ ] **Wait for next Web2/Infrastructure contest** to establish baseline
- [ ] **Study new shadow audit protocol** thoroughly
- [ ] **Review Sol's Merkl baseline** to understand the process
- [ ] **Prepare finding documentation template** for Web2 audits

### First Baseline Audit Requirements
1. **Document ALL findings** using new protocol template
2. **Include reasoning** for each finding identified  
3. **Set confidence levels** honestly
4. **Submit complete findings** before seeing contest results
5. **Perform thorough analysis** after results available

### Focus Areas for Web2/Infrastructure Security
- **API security** vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- **Authentication/Authorization** bypasses
- **Input validation** and injection attacks
- **Infrastructure configuration** security
- **Container/Docker** security issues
- **CI/CD pipeline** vulnerabilities
- **Database security** and access controls
- **Network security** and firewall configs

## Expected Knowledge Strengths
Based on specialization in Web2/Infrastructure:
- Deep understanding of OWASP Top 10
- Experience with infrastructure security
- API security and testing methodologies
- Container and deployment security
- CI/CD security best practices

## Performance Targets

### Month 1 (Baseline Establishment)
- **Complete 2 shadow audits** with new protocol
- **Establish precision/recall baseline** 
- **Identify top 3 knowledge gaps**
- **Update knowledge base** with new patterns

### Month 2-3 (Improvement)
- **Achieve 40%+ precision, 20%+ recall**
- **Reduce false positive rate** below 60%
- **Complete 4 more shadow audits**
- **Develop Web2/Infrastructure-specific expertise**

### Month 4-6 (Target Performance)
- **Achieve 80%+ precision, 60%+ recall**
- **Reduce false positive rate** below 20%  
- **Become reliable Web2/Infrastructure auditor** for Carlos
- **Lead on infrastructure security engagements**

## Specialization Notes

### Web2 Contest Availability
- **CodeHawks** sometimes has Web2/Infrastructure contests
- **Immunefi** bug bounty programs for infrastructure
- **HackerOne** live programs for baseline practice
- **Custom infrastructure audits** for Zealynx clients

### Value Proposition
- Complementary to smart contract auditing
- Expanding Zealynx service offerings
- Higher hourly rates for infrastructure expertise
- Less crowded field than smart contract auditing

## Notes for Carlos

### Current Status
Ghost needs to establish baseline with new methodology. Previous work provides experience but no measurable performance metrics.

### Specialization Value
- Web2/Infrastructure expertise expands Zealynx capabilities
- Complement to smart contract auditing services
- Potential for higher-value enterprise clients
- Growing demand for Web3 infrastructure security

### Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Wait for appropriate contest, study new protocol
- **Week 3-4:** Complete first baseline shadow audit (possibly bug bounty)
- **Month 2-3:** Establish reliable performance metrics  
- **Month 4-6:** Achieve professional auditor performance levels

**Next Step:** Identify next Web2/Infrastructure contest or bug bounty for baseline establishment.
