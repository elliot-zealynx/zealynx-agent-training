# Raven (AI Red Team) - Performance Tracking

**Agent:** Raven  
**Specialization:** AI Systems Security  
**Started Tracking:** February 10, 2026

## Performance Summary

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Precision | TBD | >80% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| Recall | TBD | >60% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| False Positive Rate | TBD | <20% | 📊 Needs Baseline |
| Shadow Audits Completed | 2 (old method) | 20+ | 📊 Starting New Protocol |

## Current Status: NEEDS BASELINE

Raven has limited shadow audit experience and needs to establish baseline performance with the new tracking system.

### Previous Shadow Audits (Pre-New Protocol)
*Note: Previous audits used old methodology - only final results, no false positive tracking*
- 2026-02-03: Shadow exercise (basic tracking)

## Next Actions

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
- [ ] **Wait for next AI/ML security contest** to establish baseline
- [ ] **Study new shadow audit protocol** thoroughly
- [ ] **Review Sol's Merkl baseline** to understand the process
- [ ] **Prepare finding documentation template** for AI security audits

### First Baseline Audit Requirements
1. **Document ALL findings** using new protocol template
2. **Include reasoning** for each finding identified  
3. **Set confidence levels** honestly
4. **Submit complete findings** before seeing contest results
5. **Perform thorough analysis** after results available

### Focus Areas for AI Systems Security
- **Prompt injection** and manipulation attacks
- **Model poisoning** and backdoor attacks
- **Data extraction** from language models
- **Adversarial examples** and evasion attacks
- **AI model inference** attacks
- **Training data** security and privacy
- **AI API security** and rate limiting
- **Model deployment** security
- **AI-powered smart contract** vulnerabilities

## Expected Knowledge Strengths
Based on specialization in AI Security:
- Understanding of ML/AI attack vectors
- Experience with prompt engineering and manipulation
- Knowledge of AI model vulnerabilities
- Familiarity with AI red team methodologies

## Performance Targets

### Month 1 (Baseline Establishment)
- **Complete 2 shadow audits** with new protocol
- **Establish precision/recall baseline** 
- **Identify top 3 knowledge gaps**
- **Update knowledge base** with new patterns

### Month 2-3 (Improvement)
- **Achieve 40%+ precision, 20%+ recall**
- **Reduce false positive rate** below 60%
- **Complete 4 more shadow audits**
- **Develop AI security-specific expertise**

### Month 4-6 (Target Performance)
- **Achieve 80%+ precision, 60%+ recall**
- **Reduce false positive rate** below 20%  
- **Become reliable AI security auditor** for Carlos
- **Lead on AI red team engagements**

## Specialization Notes

### AI Security Contest Availability
- **AI red team competitions** (DEFCON AI Village)
- **Bug bounty programs** for AI/ML systems
- **Academic AI security challenges**
- **Internal Zealynx AI systems** security assessments
- **Client AI/ML security** audits

### Unique Value Proposition
- **Emerging field** with high demand
- **Limited competition** in AI security expertise
- **High-value specialty** for AI-powered clients
- **Future-focused** as AI adoption increases

### AI + Smart Contract Intersection
- **AI-powered DeFi protocols** security
- **AI agent smart contracts** (like Chitin ID found in GitHub intelligence)
- **AI model oracle** systems security
- **Decentralized AI** network security

## Notes for Carlos

### Current Status
Raven has the least shadow audit experience but covers the most emerging/valuable specialty area.

### Specialization Value
- **High-growth market:** AI security demand increasing rapidly
- **Limited expertise:** Few auditors specialize in AI security
- **Premium rates:** AI security commands higher hourly rates
- **Future-proof:** Anticipates market needs as AI adoption grows
- **Unique positioning:** Combines AI security with Web3 expertise

### Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Wait for appropriate contest, study new protocol
- **Week 3-4:** Complete first baseline shadow audit (AI security focus)
- **Month 2-3:** Establish reliable performance metrics  
- **Month 4-6:** Achieve professional auditor performance levels

### Strategic Importance
Raven's AI security expertise positions Zealynx ahead of competitors in the emerging AI+Web3 security market. Early investment in this capability could yield significant returns as AI-powered protocols proliferate.

**Next Step:** Identify next AI/ML security contest or create internal AI system assessment for baseline establishment.
